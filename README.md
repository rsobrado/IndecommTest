# Indecomm FrontEnd Developer Angular Test
### Challenge
Develop a SPA using Angular 7 that consumes any real time data stream (for examples see https://www.pubnub.com/developers/realtime-data-streams/), performs some aggregation of the data and display the aggregate values on the page.

Build a web application that consumes the twitter data stream, filters by a user supplied hash tag, and displays average number of tweets per minute as well as a sample of the country code of origin.
Again, we hope this challenge is interesting and will provoke a higher level of discussion as we continue this process.
